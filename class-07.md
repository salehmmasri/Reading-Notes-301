# API

### How I explained REST to my brother ‚úèÔ∏è
- From what I understand of this article polymorphism applies to REST by saying that we can have multiple nouns, ie things to be selected that have the same verb applied to them I.E.

1. POST
2. GET
3. PUT
4. DELETE.
- Which relate to SQL with üé∞

- INSERT
- SELECT
- UPDATE
- DELETE.
- API Keys 
*Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment.*
